              synfig releases

 0.61.08 (SVN 1???) - February ??, 2008 - Bug fixes

 * Synfig is now translatable using gettext.  Currently only a Spanish
   translation exists.

 * Build
   -----
        Removed the 'bootstrap' script for building.  Use autoreconf
        instead.

        Fixed errors and warnings detected by a pre-release version of
        g++ 4.3.

 * Layers
   ------
        New layer, 'Duplicate'.  This is an experimental feature, but
        seems to work quite well.  It can be used to clone the layers
        under it multiple times. ( http://synfig.org/Duplicate_Layer )

         * PasteCanvas
           -----------
                Prevent a "bad_alloc" error in the 'PasteCanvas' layer
                caused by the bounding boxes changing when the user
                changes parameters while rendering.

                Allow zooming furter in to nested PasteCanvas
                layers. (#1809480)

         * Plant Layer
           -----------
                New parameter "reverse" in the Plant layer allows
                plants to be rendered back-to-front.

                Fix: Use the 'width' of each blinepoint in the plant
                layer to affect the velocities.  Patch from
                genete. (#1831897)

                Add the 'offset' parameter to the Plant layer.

                Don't let 'select all' select the green ducks of a
                plant layer.

                Do some sanity checking on Plant layer parameters.

         * Stretch
           -------
                Prevent a crash when rendering a 'Stretch' layer with
                zero x or y amount. (#1823082)

                Make the 'Stretch' layer's "amount" duck be relative
                to the center duck.

         * Text
           ----
                Allow multibyte characters in the Text layer. Patch by
                Niki W. Waibel. (#1852208)

                First step towards fixing the problem of distorted
                'Text' layers not rendering correctly at tile borders.

         * Misc
           ----
                Shade: Make the quality of the 'Shade' layer worse at
                quality 10 than it is at quality 9!

                Shape: Rename the 'Position' parameter to 'Offset' for
                all the 'Shape' layers.

                Spherize: Fix clipping for tile-based rendering in
                Spherize layer.

                Star: New parameter "regular polygon" in the 'Star'
                layer allows regular polygons to be drawn.

                Time Loop: New version 0.2 of the 'Time Loop'
                layer. It uses the same parameters as the newly added
                Time Loop ValueNode.

                Warp: Fix a problem with the 'Warp' layer where some
                tiles weren't being rendered.

 * ValueNodes
   ----------
        Add new type: 'Cos', to calculate cosines.
        ( http://wiki.synfig.com/Convert#Cos )

        Add new type: 'Duplicate', only used by the Duplicate layer.
        ( http://synfig.org/Convert#Duplicate )

        Add new type: 'From Integer', to convert integers to other
        types for linking to.  Currently disabled.
        ( http://synfig.org/Convert#From_Integer )

        Add new type: 'Random', to generate pseudo-random values.
        ( http://synfig.org/Convert#Random )

        Add new type: 'Reciprocal', to calculate reciprocals.
        ( http://synfig.org/Convert#Reciprocal )

        Add new type: 'Reverse Tangent', to reverse the direction of
        tangents. ( http://synfig.org/Convert#Reverse_Tangent )

        Add new type: 'Switch', to switch between two alternative
        values. ( http://synfig.org/Convert#Switch )

        Add new type: 'Time Loop', to allow individual parameters to
        be time looped, like the Time Loop layer, but for individual
        parameters. ( http://synfig.org/Convert#Time_Loop )

        Add new type: 'aTan2', to calculate inverse tangents.
        ( http://synfig.org/Convert#aTan2 )

        Extended types: 'Add' and 'Subtract' now work with gradients.

 * Targets
   -------
        Fix one memory leak and one filehandle leak in target 'png'..

        Fix the ffmpeg/dv/imagemagick targets/importers on Windows.

        Improved the 'imagemagick' target so it can create a series of
        numbered images.

        Fixed the 'mng' and 'yuv420p' targets.

        Security fixes: arbitrary code execution when rendering
        specially crafted .sif files.

        Show which output target is used if it has been chosen
        automatically, not specified by the user.

 * Blend Methods
   -------------
        Don't accept illegal values for 'blend_method'.  Use
        'Composite' instead.

        Re-enable the 'alpha brighten' and 'alpha darken' blend
        methods.

        Fix the 'straight', 'straight onto' and 'alpha brighten' blend
        methods.  Even completely transparent pixels in the top layer
        should affect the result of these blends.  Existing .sif files
        which relied on the previously broken behavior should still
        render correctly for the most part.

 * Canvases
   --------
        Fix a crash that was happening if we had 2 exported canvases
        in a .sif file where the 2nd contained a pastecanvas that used
        the 1st as its canvas.  The canvases are destructed in the
        order in which they appear in the .sif file, so by the time
        the 2nd is destroyed, the pastecanvas it contains no longer
        has a valid canvas parameter.  The fix is to clear the canvas
        parameter of any pastecanvases using a canvas when the canvas
        itself is destroyed.

        Encapsulations containing imported images fail to clone
        properly (#1838132)

 * SIF Files
   ---------
        Refer the user to 'http://synfig.org/Convert#Compatibility' if
        we try to load a .sif file that uses a not-yet-implemented
        ValueNode type, or that tries using a ValueNode with a type
        which it doesn't yet support.

        Changed the .sif file format.  'Composite' and 'Radial
        Composite' ValueNodes used to be saved with obscure XML
        element names <c1>, <c2>, etc.  Now we use more readable names
        <point>, <width>, etc.  The old version is still accepted, and
        can still be written by selecting the old version from the
        "Save As..." dialog.  The new format will not be accepted by
        previous releases of Synfig.

        New Feature: Allow saving .sif files in formats that can be
        read by versions 0.61.07 and older.

        Add information about which valuenode types were added in
        which release.  Don't save new types in old format files.

        Fix: Prevent a crash when loading a .sif file with 'use=""' in
        it.

        Fix: Prevent studio crashing when loading a document that
        contains an unknown valuenode type from a newer version of
        synfig. Simply refuse to load the document instead. (#1811250)

 * Misc
   ----
        Don't render feathering of circles or shapes (ie. outlines,
        regions, stars, polygons, etc), or motion blur, blur, or
        radial blur layers when the quality is 10.

        New feature: allow importing of lipsynced voice animations
        from Papagayo (#1879688)

        Fix: Inserting a new item into a list in animation mode caused
        unpredicatable renders before the time of
        insertion. (#1841280)

        Fix: The hex color code parser is much more forgiving now.
        Previously spaces before or after the color code would cause
        it to fail.

        Fix: Don't treat the required values of command line flags as
        flags themselves. (#1695735)

        Fix: Initialise the 'time_last_changed' when creating a Node.
        Previously it was being left at a random value.
