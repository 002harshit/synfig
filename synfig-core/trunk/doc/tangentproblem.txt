4        Scale                                                                   Real
5        Displacement                                                            Angle
7        Fixed Length                                                            bool
8        Fixed Angle                                                             bool

'Current' is the current vertex in the bline (where the tangent lies) it is not a parameter
'Next' is the next vertex in the bline relative to Current
'Previous' it is the previous vertex in the bline relative to Current.

If the bline 'loop' boolean is on:
	1) If Current is the last vertex in the list, then Next is the first in the list of the bline
	2) If Current is the first vertex in the list, then Previous is the last in the list of the bline

If the bline 'loop' boolean is off:
	1) If Current is the last vertex in the list, then Next is Current.
	2) If Current is the first vertex in the list, then Previous Current.

Resulting Tangent (radius, angle) is defined by:
Let's call: V=Next-Previous

Radius:
If Fixed Length is on:  radious = Scale
If Fixed Length is off: radius= |V|*Scale

Angle:
If Fixed Length is on:  angle = Displacement
If Fixed Length is off: angle=atan2(V.y,V.x) + Displacement
