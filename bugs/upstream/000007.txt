------------------------------------------------------------------------

This also happens in the master branch with blines.

1. draw a bline outline
2. right-click it and 'duplicate'
3. select the duplicate (it's the top one in the layer list)
4. stretch the params dialog so it's about half the screen width and height
5. expand the vertices
6. scroll down so the vertices start towards the top of the params panel
7. remove (smart) the first vertex - it crashes

See sf.net bug #2412776.
