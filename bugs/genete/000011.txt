Subject: Edit a parent parameter waypoint doesn't seems to work

Create a skeleton, go to animation mode, modify the parent paramter of a bone.
It creates a waypoint. Expand the bone and right click the waypoint.
It would open a dialog to edit the parent paramter.
The drop down list doesn't seems to work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I right-click a waypoint, I see a menu, not a dialog.  The menu
seems to act as it should.  Did you mean 'menu' where you wrote
'dialog'?  Or did you mean to say that I should click 'Edit' to get
the edit dialog?  And what exactly doesn't work?
