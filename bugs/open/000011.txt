Subject: Edit a parent parameter waypoint doesn't seems to work

Create a skeleton, go to animation mode, modify the parent paramter of a bone.
It creates a waypoint. Expand the bone and right click the waypoint.
It would open a dialog to edit the parent paramter.
The drop down list doesn't seems to work.
