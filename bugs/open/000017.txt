Subject: Vertices converted to Bone Influence saved to file doesn't load

Create a bline, convert the Vertex paramterer to Bone Influence
Save
Close ss
Open ss and load the saved file. It fails.

But if you create a skeleton, and link the bones form the Bone Influence
to exported bones of the skeleton and clear the history (to remove the bones
form the Bone influence) you can save and load the file properly.
