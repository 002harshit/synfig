Subject: Convert the Setup Origin or the Animated Origin subparams of a bone can lead a loop

When the Setup Origin or the Animated Origin subparameters of a bone were available they
can potentially converted to be a bone influence type so they can have a bone in the
bone weight pair list. That bone could be linked to the bone itself so it can produce
a loop.
That convert types should not be allowed for the vertex type subparams of the bone
or there must be a checking to prevent link that bone sub-subparam to any other bone reference
that has the bone in question as parent or linked.
