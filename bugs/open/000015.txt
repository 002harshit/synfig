Subject: Inserted bones doesn't offer other parent in the bone choose widget than the <None>

new file,
new skeleton,
insert item smart,
select the inserted and try to change its parent,
only <None> is offered

------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you deleted the inserted and then add a new one the deleted is offerd to the new inserted.
It seems like if they belong to a different canvas?
