Subject: Remove all bones from the static list makes it impossible to add a new one.

Add a new skeleton layer, Delete all the Bones (Delete Item Smart)
The list becomes empty (and not expandable). Converting to Static List fails:

quote:
Convert 'Layer Parameter (Skeleton):Bones' to ValueNode type
 'Static List': Unable to create new value node

On the other hand, doing Disconnect instead of deleting all the bones
allows the user to convert it again to Static List recovering the same bones and
all the previous parent connections.
