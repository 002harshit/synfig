2 'potential crash' bugs:

 000008	fix more in the 'sibling parent link' series
 000014	there's a potential to create loops by connecting

3 'canvas=0' bugs:

 000013	removing a boneweightpair from the list in boneinfluence crashes because CANVAS=0
 000015	new bones inserted into a skeleton have CANVAS=0 so parent menu doesn't show original skeleton bones
 000017	creating to boneinfluence creates a new bone with CANVAS=0 so saving doesn't save the bone
