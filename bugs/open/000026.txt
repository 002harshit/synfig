Subject: edit a valuenode-valued waypoint doesn't trigger update of parent

Example: ~chris/Desktop/anim/dynamic-waypoints.sifz

set preview quality to 1 (best) and the time to be 5s
edit the 'left rate' child node to be 1 instead of 0.
the workarea doesn't reflect any change.
move the time slider away from 5s and back to 5s.
the workarea now reflects the change.

Usually when a node is edited, the on_changed() methods cause all
ancestors of the node to update themselves, but waypoints don't
inherit from Node, and so don't have the concept of a parent_set to
update when changed.

The use of valuenodes as the value of waypoints is unusual in synfig,
but the addition of bones makes it more common, since re-parenting
causes the use of valuenode waypoints.

Example: ~chris/Desktop/anim/bones/test2.sifz

Select either of the 'anim' layers, edit the bone ducks, note that
nothing gets updated.
